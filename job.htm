<p>
The above job description is for a Business Analyst role within Westpac. The main features of this role seem to be stakeholder management, customer service, problem solving, change implementation, process improvement, process design, testing, support and communication. The position is appealing to me because it appears to be a role where you are given a task or a desired outcome and left to our own devices to figure out the best way to achieve the outcome that satisfies all of the stakeholders involved. 
</p>
<p>I believe some skills/experience that are required for this role would include:</p>
<ul>
<dt>Microsoft Office</dt>
<dt>SharePoint</dt>
<dt>Negotiation</dt>
<dt>SQL</dt>
<dt>At least one coding language</dt>
<dt>Critical thinking</dt>
<dt>Communication</dt>
<dt>Problem solving</dt>
<dt>Time management</dt>
<dt>Business writing (procedures, updates, comms)</dt>
<dt>Customer service</dt>
<dt>Research skills</dt>
<dt>Record keeping</dt>
<p>I already possess a number of these skills. I am proficient with Microsoft Office and Sharepoint, I write procedures, comms and updates in my current role, I have a customer service background and I have strong critical thinking, time management and problem solving skills. The areas that I need to work on are SQL, coding, negotiation, research skills and record keeping. I think that University study will help with SQL, coding and research skills. I can source online courses to help with record keeping and negotiation. SQL and coding also have a lot of classes freely available on the internet including YouTube videos so I have no doubt that I would have no issues learning these skills.</p>
